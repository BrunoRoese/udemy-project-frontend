#Ecommerce project udemy

This is the frontend repository for my ecommerce project

You can find the backend repository here: https://github.com/BrunoRoese/ecommerce-udemy-project

This project was made using Angular.

I'm using NgRx for state management. 

Will try to use tailwind as my styling framework.

I'm doing this project for study purpose.

I'm open for any suggestions and help, thank you!
